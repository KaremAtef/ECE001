        <h2>Advantages of AI</h2>
        <div>
            The advantages of Artificial intelligence applications are enormous and can revolutionize any professional sector. Let’s see some of them
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Reduction in Human Error:</li> <div>The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.</div>
            <br>
            <li>Takes risks instead of Humans:</li> <div>This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial intelligence. We can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars, defuse a bomb, explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil, it can be used effectively in any kind of natural or man-made disasters.</div>
            <br>
            <li>Available 24x7:</li> <div>An Average human will work for 4–6 hours a day excluding the breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for refreshing themselves and get ready for a new day of work and they even have weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life and personal life. But using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored, unlike humans.</div>
